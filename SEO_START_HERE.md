## ✅ What I Fixed For You

### 1. **Added Page Metadata** (The Critical Issue)
Your collection pages (hymns, songs) were missing metadata. I added:
- ✅ Proper page titles for search engines
- ✅ Unique descriptions for each page
- ✅ Keywords optimization
- ✅ Open Graph tags for social sharing

**Result**: Search engines can now understand what each page is about.

### 2. **Added Structured Data** (Google's "Rosetta Stone")
Added JSON-LD schemas so Google understands:
- ✅ Who you are (Organization)
- ✅ What you offer (WebSite + Search functionality)

**Result**: Richer search results, better visibility.

### 3. **Pages Updated**
- ✅ Hymns collection
- ✅ Songs collection  
- ✅ About page
- ✅ Contact page
- ✅ Drummer tool
- ✅ Metronome tool
- ✅ Extras & Resources

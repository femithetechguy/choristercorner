      "Verse 1:\nWhen peace like a river attendeth my way,\nWhen sorrows like sea billows roll;\nWhatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,\nIt is well, it is well with my soul.",
      "Refrain:\nIt is well with my soul,\nIt is well, it is well with my soul.",
      "Verse 2:\nThough Satan should buffet, though trials should come,\nLet this blest assurance control,\nThat Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,\nAnd hath shed His own blood for my soul.",
      "Verse 3:\nMy sin—oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!—\nMy sin, not in part but the whole,\nIs nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,\nPraise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!",
      "Verse 4:\nAnd Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,\nThe clouds be rolled back as a scroll;\nThe trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,\nEven so, it is well with my soul."
